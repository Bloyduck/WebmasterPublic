    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="insulationBasic">
    <p>Insulation is a layer of protective material that serves to resist heat flow and maintain a comfortable temperature inside your home. The flow of heat dictates that heat always moves from a warmer to a cooler place. Taking</p>
    <p>into perspective, during the winter, heat within your home will constantly seep outside to escape to the colder air. And in the summer, outside heat will seep inside your home where it’s cooler. Among the various ways to</p>
    <p>reduce cooling and heating costs, insulation is one of the most cost-effective for saving noticeable amounts on your energy bill. </p>
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h2>The R-Value</h2>
    <p>Insulation materials are typically rated with a “R” value, with a higher value indicating a better level of resistance to heat and its insulating effectiveness. Consider the thickness, material, and R-value that is appropriate</p>
    <p>for your home and climate. To learn more about recommended R-values for areas in the U.S., see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/identify-problems-you-want-fix/diy-checks-inspections/insulation-r-values&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711403379200309&usg=AOvVaw2rMXQs5jtLcYE8cJWjF_20" target = "_blank"> Energy Star | Recommended Home R-Values.</a> </p>

  <h1>Types of Insulation</h1>
</div>

<div class = "in_typeLeft">
  <h2>Reflective Systems and Radiant Barriers</h2>
  <p>Radiant heat travels in a straight line, typically heating up any solid it travels through by transferring its energy. Left alone, it will naturally pass through the exterior of the house, heating up the interior as a result. These types of insulation focus on primarily reflecting radiant heat rather than decreasing the heat flow through and from your home.</p>
  <h3>Radiant</h3>
  <ul class = "leftList">
    <li>Radiant barriers primarily use reflective material like aluminum foil, over a backing of kraft paper, foam board, or plastic film.</li>
    <li>Radiant barriers are typically installed on attics.</li>
    <li>Radiant barriers prevent radiant heat from being absorbed by the attic and transferred into the interior of the house.</li>
    <li>Not measured in R-value</li>
    <li>Most effective in hot climates, but will reduce heat loss in the winter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Radiant barrier installation costs $0.30 to $2.00 per square foot for labor and materials. Installing an attic radiant barrier costs $350 to $2,700, depending on the attic size and installment method.</p>
  
  <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>

  <h3>Reflective</h3>
  <ul class = "leftList">
    <li>Reflective insulation includes reflective surfaces as well as thermal insulation materials.</li>
    <li>The more layers of aluminum foil and air spaces, the higher the R-value and thermal resistance.</li>
    <li>Works for radiant, conductive, and convective heat transfer.</li>
    <li>Usable in confined spaces like wall stud cavities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reflective insulation costs $0.60 to $2.40 per square foot with installation with the reflective materials costing $0.30 to $0.80 per square foot.</p>
</div>

<div class = "in_typeRight">
  <h2>Foam Board/Rigid Foam Insulation</h2>
  <p>Foam board insulation are typically high R-value insulations and can be virtually anywhere in your home to provide for high thermal resistance.</p>
  <ul class = "rightList">
    <li>Effective in exterior wall sheathing, interior sheathing for basement walls, and special applications such as attic hatches.</li>
    <li>Effective for floors, foundation, low sloped ceiling.</li>
    <li>Common materials used are polystyrene, polyisocyanurate or polyurethane.</li>
    <li>Relatively easy to install.</li>
    <li>Moisture resistant</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rigid foam boards cost between $0.60 and $2 per square foot, with an average cost of $1.50 per square foot, though the price varies depending on the r value, material used, and area covered. </p>
</div>

<div class = "in_typeLeft">
  <h2>Blanket: Batt and Roll Insulation</h2>
  <p>Blanket insulations are one of the most common and affordable type of insulation. It is typically made out of flexible fibers like fiberglass, natural fibers and mineral wool.</p>
  <ul class = "leftList">
    <li>Most effective on unfinished walls and floors or ceilings.</li>
    <li>High R-values typically range from an additional R-2.9 to R-3.8 for every inch of thickness.</li>
    <li>May come with attached facing for vapor/air barriers and or more fire resistance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The average cost of blanket insulation ranges from $0.65 and $2.00 per square foot.</p>
</div>

<div class = "in_typeRight">
  <h2>Loose-fill/Blown-In Insulation</h2>
  <p>Loose-fill insulation consists of small particles of insulation materials like foam and fiber allowing it to conform to any space that may be difficult for other insulation to install. The common materials include cellulose, fiberglass, and mineral wool.</p>
  <ul class = "rightList">
    <li>Can be installed in enclosed spaces like walls as well unclosed spaces like attics.</li>
    <li>Effective at covering small areas</li>
    <li>Changes in R-value do not correlate with thickness.</li>
    <li>Typically blown into place through special equipment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Loose-fill insulation typically costs from $1.65 and $3.80 per square foot.</p>

<div class = "insulationTax">
  <h1>Insulation Tax Rebate</h1>
  <p>The tax credit is in effect from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2032 and applies to any equipment installment in relation to energy efficiency and home improvement. Homeowners are able to claim 30% of product cost, totalling</p>
  <p>to a $1200 limit for insulation in combination with other improvements to the home envelope like doors and windows.</p>
  <h3>Eligibility</h3>
  <ul class = "ins_taxList">
  <li>Typical bulk insulation products like blankets, rigid boards, and blow-in sprays.</li>
  <li>Products that provide air seal like house wrap as long as it’s certified with a Manufacturers Certification Statement.</li>
  </ul>
