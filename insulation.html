  <div class="insulationBasic">
    <p>Insulation is a layer of protective material that serves to resist heat flow and maintain a comfortable temperature inside your home. The flow of heat dictates that heat always moves from a warmer to a cooler place. Taking</p>
    <p>into perspective, during the winter, heat within your home will constantly seep outside to escape to the colder air. And in the summer, outside heat will seep inside your home where it’s cooler. Among the various ways to</p>
    <p>reduce cooling and heating costs, insulation is one of the most cost-effective for saving noticeable amounts on your energy bill. </p>

    <h2>The R-Value</h2>
    <p>Insulation materials are typically rated with a “R” value, with a higher value indicating a better level of resistance to heat and its insulating effectiveness. Consider the thickness, material, and R-value that is appropriate</p>
    <p>for your home and climate. To learn more about recommended R-values for areas in the U.S., see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/identify-problems-you-want-fix/diy-checks-inspections/insulation-r-values&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711403379200309&usg=AOvVaw2rMXQs5jtLcYE8cJWjF_20" target = "_blank"> Energy Star | Recommended Home R-Values.</a> </p>
