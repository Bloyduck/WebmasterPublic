  <h3>Basic Information</h3>
</div>

<div class="solarBasic">
  <p>Electricity from solar energy is primarily supplied by solar PV panels. These panels are made up of PV cells, which absorb the energy from sunlight and convert it to an electrical current. This current then flows into an</p>
  <p>apparatus called a power inverter, which transforms the energy into usable electricity. As panels use up less space, they are best suited for residential buildings, where they are typically installed to cover areas of rooftops.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Solar panels are generally measured by efficency percentages in how well they proudce usable electricity.</p>

  <h1>Cost and Tax Rebate</h1>
  <h3>The average cost of solar panels ranges from: Low: $4,000 | Average: $16,000 | High - $32,000</h3>
  <br><br>
  <p>The tax credit covers a specific percentage of the solar system’s costs, reducing the taxpayer’s federal income tax liability by that amount. Tax credit of up to 30% will be eligible for solar systems installed in 2022 and will </p>
  <p>continue to be offered for systems installed in later years up to 2032. For systems installed in 2033, it will decrease to 26% and systems installed in 2034, will be eligible for a 22% tax credit. Tax credit will expire in 2035 unless</p>
  <p>renewed by Congress. </p>
