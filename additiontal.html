  <h2>Buying Green Energy</h2>
  <p>Outside of additions to the home, homeowners are able to contribute to green solutions by switching to sources that generate renewable energy for homes. This includes energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, biomass, or hydroelectric methods.</p> 
  <p>Suppliers are certified as a third party guarantee that the green energy produced meets environmental standards. Below are a few of the most available and recommended options for homeowners in the states.</p>

    <h3> - Green Pricing</h3>
    <p>Green pricing is commonly offered by several utility companies who will charge an additional premium on your electric bill for the cost to switch to a source that generates renewable energy. To see your options, you can contact your utility for more information. </p>
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h3>- Competitive Electricity Markets</h3>
    <p>In certain states, they offer alternative suppliers in the area besides your utility to power your home with renewable energy. Homeowners in such areas will be able to select multiple choices of green suppliers, with your fees for their services appearing on your utility bill. In addition to energy products, several suppliers may also offer renewable energy certificates (RECs). Note that this tends to increase prices due to the bundling of both the REC and renewable energy. </p>

    <h3>- Green Certificates/RECs</h3>
    <p>Green certificates or renewable energy certificates are tradable certificates serving as proof that one megawatt-hour of energy of electricity was generated by a renewable source and transferred into the electricity grid. Suppliers who generate RECs often sell them to individuals and businesses who wish to aid the cause for clean power generation. While RECs serve little  practical purpose by itself, it is an option for homeowners who can not afford to modify or add green installments to their home but still wish to support green energy.</p>
