  <h2>Better Alternatives</h2>
  <p>There are many decisions that are made in life that YOU can do with more green energy and less carbon emissions.<br>Here are some better alternates to better your life and the planets life: </p>
  <div class = "betterAlternatives">
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h3> - Public Transportation & Biking/Walking</h3>
    <p>Public transportation helps the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it uses less energy compared to someone using their private vehicle. Biking or walking can also help the environment by decreasing motor vehicle usage and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.</p>
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h3> - Efficient Energy and Water Usage</h3>
    <p>Efficient energy can decrease water use which would lower greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Having the necessary usage of water can make more water available in the lakes, rivers, and streams that we use for recreation and wildlife uses to survive.</p>
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h3> - Reduced buying of one-time-use products</h3>
    <p>Limiting plastic products people obtain like bags, foam cups, containers, straws, and utensils could significantly reduce plastic pollution.</p>
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h3> - Compost</h3>
    <p>Composting helps get rid of waste that would normally be dumped into landfills or incinerated. The prevention of such events reduces pollution to the surrounding land and limits emissions from burning the waste. In addition, it helps build healthy soil by improving plant growth and health and providing plant nutrients in a stable organic form.</p>
    <div style = "white-space: pre"> </div>
    <h3> - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h3>
    <p>We create a healthier planet for ourselves and future generations by reducing unhealthy habits, reusing, and recycling. These practices reduce the need for manufacturers to produce goods and processing of raw materials which creates substantial air and water pollution through emissions and industrial waste.</p>
